## Solution Overview

JBoss EAP (Enterprise Application Platform) is an open source platform for highly transactional, web-scale Java applications. EAP combines the familiar and popular Jakarta EE specifications with the latest technologies, like Microprofile, to modernize your applications from traditional Java EE into the new world of DevOps, cloud, containers, and microservices. EAP includes everything needed to build, run, deploy, and manage enterprise Java applications in a variety of environments, including on-premises, virtual environments, and in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) is a customer-driven, end-to-end solution that provides tools for subscription status and management and integrates with Red Hat's system management tools. To obtain an RHSM account for JBoss EAP, go to: www.redhat.com.

## Template Solution Architecture

This Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template creates all the Azure compute resources to run JBoss EAP 7.2 setup on RHEL 7.7 VM. The following resources are created by this template:

- RHEL 7.7 Virtual Machine
- Public IP 
- Virtual Network 
- Network Security Group 
- JBoss EAP 7.2 setup on the RHEL VM
- Sample Java application named **JBoss-EAP on Azure** deployed on JBoss EAP 7.2

Following is the Architecture:

## Subscriptions and Costs

This quickstart is designed to give multiple choice in terms of RHEL OS licensing. 

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS as PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) or BYOS (Bring-Your-Own-Subscription).
- Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) is available through BYOS (Bring-Your-Own-Subscription) only.


#### Using RHEL OS with PAYG Model

By default this template uses the On-Demand Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) image from the Azure Gallery. When using this On-Demand image, there is an additional hourly RHEL subscription charge for using this image on top of the normal compute, network and storage costs. At the same time, the instance will be registered to your Red Hat subscription, so you will also be using one of your entitlements. This will lead to "double billing". To avoid this, you would need to build your own RHEL image, which is defined in this [Red Hat KB article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/uploading-rhel-image-to-azure).

Check [Red Hat Enterprise Linux pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/red-hat/) for details on the RHEL VMs pricing for PAYG model. In order to use RHEL in PAYG model, you will need an Azure Subscription with the specified payment method (RHEL 7.7 is an [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/RedHat.RedHatEnterpriseLinux77-ARM?tab=Overview) product and requires a payment method to be specified in the Azure Subscription). 

#### Using RHEL OS with BYOS Model

In order to use BYOS for RHEL OS Licensing, you need to have a valid Red Hat subscription with entitlements to use RHEL OS in Azure. Please complete the following prerequisites in order to use RHEL OS through BYOS model before you deploy this quickstart template.

1. Ensure you have RHEL OS and JBoss EAP entitlements attached to your Red Hat Subscription.
2. Authorize your Azure Subscription ID to use RHEL BYOS images. Please follow [Red Hat Subscription Management documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/html/red_hat_cloud_access_reference_guide/con-enable-subs) to complete this process. This includes multiple steps including:

    2.1 Enable Microsoft Azure as provider in your Red Hat Cloud Access Dashboard.

    2.2 Add your Azure Subscription IDs.

    2.3 Enable new products for Cloud Access on Microsoft Azure.
    
    2.4 Activate Red Hat Gold Images for your Azure Subscription. Refer to [Red Hat Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/html/red_hat_cloud_access_reference_guide/using_red_hat_gold_images#con-gold-image-azure) for more details.

    2.5 Wait for Red Hat Gold Images to be available in your Azure subscription. These are typically available within 3 hours.
    
3. Accept the Marketplace Terms and Conditions in Azure for the RHEL BYOS Images. You can complete this by running Azure CLI commands, as given below. Refer to [Red Hat Enterprise Linux BYOS Gold Images in Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/redhat/byos) for more details on this.

    3.1 Launch an Azure CLI session and authenticate with your Azure account. Refer to [Signing in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for assistance.

    3.2 Verify the RHEL BYOS images are available in your subscription by running the following CLI command. If you don't get any results here, please refer to #2 and ensure that your Azure subscription is activated for RHEL BYOS images.

    `az vm image list --offer rhel-byos --all`

    3.3 Run the following command to accept the Marketplace Terms for RHEL 7.7 BYOS.

    `az vm image terms accept --publisher redhat --offer rhel-byos --plan rhel-lvm77`

4. Your subscription is now ready to deploy RHEL 7.7 BYOS virtual machines.

#### Using JBoss EAP with BYOS Model

JBoss EAP is available on Azure through BYOS model only; you need to supply your RHSM credentials along with RHSM pool id having valid EAP entitlements when deploying this template. If you don't have EAP entitlement, obtain a [JBoss EAP evaluation subscription](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/evaluation) before you get started.
No additional steps are required for this.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Subscription compliant with licensing requirements specified in 'Subscriptions and Costs' section.

2. To deploy the template, you will need:

   - **Admin Username** and password/ssh key data which is an SSH RSA public key for your VM.

   - **JBoss EAP Username** and password
    
   - **RHSM Username** and password

   - **RHSM Pool ID for EAP and/or RHEL OS**

## Deployment Steps

Build your environment with JBoss EAP 7.2 on a VM running RHEL 7.7 on Azure by clicking the **Deploy to Azure** button and fill in the following parameter values:

   - **Subscription** - Choose the appropriate subscription for deployment.

   - **Resource Group** - Create a new Resource Group or select an existing one.

   - **Location** - Choose the appropriate location for deployment.

   - **Admin Username** - User account name for logging into the RHEL VM.

## Troubleshooting

This section includes common errors faced during deployments and details on how you can troubleshoot these errors. 

#### Azure Platform 

- If the parameter criteria are not fulfilled (ex.- the Admin Password criteria) or if any mandatory parameters are not provided in the parameters section then the deployment will not start. Also the Terms & Conditions mentioned must be accepted before clicking on Purchase.

- Once the deployment starts the resources being deployed will be visible on the deployment page and in the case of any deployment failure a more detailed failure message is available. 

- If your deployment fails at the **VM Custom Script Extension** resource, please refer to the next section for further troubleshooting.


#### Troubleshooting EAP deployment extension

This quickstart template uses VM Custom Script Extension to deploy and configure JBoss EAP and configure the sample application. Your deployment can fail at this stage due to several reasons such as:

- Invalid Red Hat Subscription credentials or EAP entitlement
- Invalid EAP/RHEL OS entitlement Pool ID

Follow the below steps to troubleshoot this further

1. Login to the provisioned virtual machine through SSH. You can retrieve the Public IP of the VM using the Azure portal VM overview page.

2. Switch to root user

    `sudo su -`

3. Enter your VM Admin Password if prompted.

4. Change directory to logging directory

    `cd /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0`

5. Review the logs in jbosseap.install.log log file. 

    `more jbosseap.install.log`

This log file will have details that include deployment failure reason and possible solutions. If your deployment failed due to RHSM account or entitlements, please refer to 'Subscriptions and Costs' section to complete the prerequisites and try again. Also note after your Azure subscription receives access to Red Hat Gold Images, you can locate them in the Azure portal. Go to **Create a Resource** > **See all**. At the top of the page, you'll see that you have private offers.
